1. The Core Narrative: A User's Journey
To bring EcoSwap to life, let's follow a typical user, Anitha, a homemaker from Thiruvananthapuram.
 * Problem: Anitha has a stack of old newspapers, some glass bottles, and an old cotton saree. She wants to dispose of them responsibly but finds the current system cumbersome. The local ആക്രിക്കട (Aakri Kada) timings are unpredictable, and she feels it's a waste to just throw away the saree.
 * Discovery: She hears about EcoSwap from a Kudumbashree meeting and downloads the app.

2. User Onboarding & Home Screen
Screen 1: Welcome & Onboarding
 * Visuals: A clean, green-themed interface with beautiful illustrations of Kerala's landscape.
 * Text: "സ്വാഗതം! നമുക്ക് ഒരുമിച്ച് മാലിന്യത്തെ സമ്പത്താക്കി മാറ്റാം." (Welcome! Let's turn waste into wealth together.)
 * Actions:
   * Simple sign-up with a mobile number (OTP verification).
   * Asks for location permission to enable hyperlocal features.
   * A quick 3-screen tutorial highlighting the core features: Swap, Sell, and Schedule.
Screen 2: The Home Dashboard
 * Visuals: A vibrant, intuitive dashboard.
 * Key Elements:
   * Top-Right: Anitha's profile icon with her EcoCoin balance (e.g., "50 EcoCoins").
   * Main Banner: "Hi Anitha, what would you like to do today?"
   * Three Large, Clear Buttons:
     * List an Item (For Swapping/Donating)
     * Upcycle Genius (Scan to get ideas)
     * Schedule Pickup (For Bulk Recyclables)
   * Bottom Navigation Bar: Home | Marketplace | Community | Wallet | Profile
   * Feed: A scrollable feed showing recent listings in her area ("Old books available in Kazhakootam," "Surplus mangoes in Pettah").

3. Prototype Feature Flow
Let's walk through how Anitha uses each core feature.
Flow 1: The Hyperlocal Exchange & AI "Upcycle Genius" (The Saree)
 * Action: Anitha has the old cotton saree. She doesn't know what to do with it. She taps the  Upcycle Genius button.
 * Screen 3: Upcycle Genius
   * The app opens her camera. She takes a picture of the saree.
   * The AI processes the image. A loading screen says, "Analyzing... Unlocking potential!"
   * Results Screen: The app identifies "Cotton Fabric." It shows her a series of cards:
     * "DIY Idea: Make a Fabric Tote Bag" (with a link to a 1-minute video tutorial).
     * "DIY Idea: Create Coasters or Rugs."
     * "Community Need: A local SHG is collecting fabric for quilts."
 * Action: Inspired, Anitha decides she doesn't have time to make a bag but wants someone else to use it. She taps a button on the results screen: "List this Item."
 * Screen 4: List Item Form
   * The form is pre-filled: "Category: Fabric," "Item: Cotton Saree."
   * Anitha chooses: "Give Away for Free."
   * She adds a short description: "Soft cotton saree, good for upcycling projects."
   * She posts it. Someone from a local crafts group claims it within an hour and arranges a pickup.
 * Reward: Once the swap is complete, Anitha receives a notification: " Congratulations! You've earned 25 EcoCoins for keeping a resource in circulation!"
Flow 2: Aakri Kada (ആക്രിക്കട) Integration (Newspapers & Bottles)
 * Action: Anitha has a pile of sorted newspapers and glass bottles. On the home screen, she taps Schedule Pickup.
 * Screen 5: Schedule Pickup
   * Step 1: Select Waste Type. She taps on "Paper" and "Glass." The app shows the approximate value per kg based on local rates.
   * Step 2: Estimate Quantity. She chooses "Approx. 5-10 kg."
   * Step 3: Choose a Time Slot. A calendar shows available slots from verified ആക്രിക്കട partners in her locality. She selects "Tomorrow, 4 PM - 6 PM."
 * The Partner Side:
   * A local recycler, Ramesh, gets a notification on his version of the EcoSwap app: "New Pickup Request from Anitha in Pettah." He accepts.
   * The next day, Ramesh completes the pickup, weighs the items, and confirms the amount in his app.
 * Action & Reward:
   * Anitha gets a notification: "Pickup complete! ₹75 has been credited to your linked UPI. You've also earned 15 EcoCoins for responsible recycling!"
Flow 3: The Eco-Marketplace & EcoCoin Economy
 * Action: Anitha now has 90 EcoCoins (50 initial + 25 for the saree + 15 for recycling). She taps on Marketplace in the bottom navigation bar.
 * Screen 6: Eco-Marketplace
   * Visuals: A clean, product-focused grid, like an Etsy for eco-products.
   * Categories: Upcycled Decor | Reusable Bags | Seed Kits | Organic Compost.
   * She sees a beautiful lamp made from a wine bottle, listed by a local artisan for ₹400.
   * The listing has a toggle: "Apply EcoCoins." She applies her 90 EcoCoins, which gives her a ₹90 discount. She buys the lamp for ₹310.
4. Technical Stack for Hackathon Pitch
 * Mobile App: Flutter or React Native (To build for both Android and iOS with a single codebase).
 * Backend: Node.js (Express) or Python (Django/Flask) (For rapid API development).
 * Database: PostgreSQL (for structured data like users, listings, transactions) and MongoDB (for flexible data like community posts).
 * AI Image Recognition ("Upcycle Genius"):
   * Prototype: Use a pre-trained model via Google Cloud Vision API or Amazon Rekognition for object detection.
   * Long-term: Fine-tune a model like TensorFlow Lite on a custom dataset for better accuracy on common household waste items.
 * Geo-services: Google Maps API for location, scheduling, and finding local partners.
 * Deployment: Google Cloud Platform or AWS.
5. Monetization & Sustainability Model
 * Commission Fee: A small percentage (e.g., 5-10%) on all sales in the Eco-Marketplace.
 * Service Fee (B2B): A nominal service fee (e.g., ₹5-₹10) per pickup, charged to the ആക്രിക്കട owner for the verified, pre-sorted lead. Alternatively, a monthly subscription model for them.
 * Platform as a Service (PaaS): A subscription fee for Haritha Karma Sena or Colleges to use the platform's backend for managing their community, sending targeted notifications, and tracking impact data.
 * Donations: The optional donation feature to support the platform's operations and fund specific community green initiatives.
Conclusion for the Judges
"Project EcoSwap is more than just an app; it's a socio-economic engine for a circular Kerala. By connecting households, recyclers, and community groups through a single, rewarding platform, we are not just managing waste—we are creating value, empowering local economies, and building a culture of sustainability from the ground up. Our prototype demonstrates a viable, scalable, and user-centric solution to a pressing local problem. 

Thank you.
