# Project EcoSwap: 

    The Community-Powered Circular Economy


EcoSwap is a tech-driven platform designed for Kerala that transforms community waste into wealth and resources. It bridges the gap between households, local recyclers (ആക്രിക്കട), and community initiatives (ഹരിതകർമ്മസേന), creating a sustainable, circular and beautiful economy.

## Problem Statement

While awareness about environmental sustainability is growing, a significant gap exists in our communities. Households struggle with proper waste segregation, valuable resources are lost to landfills, and local recyclers and initiatives lack efficient tools to connect with residents. The linear "take-make-dispose" model persists due to a lack of convenient, rewarding alternatives.

Our Solution :  How might we create a single, unified platform that not only makes sustainable living easy and rewarding for individuals but also empowers local businesses and community groups?

EcoSwap tackles this by integrating a hyperlocal sharing network, an AI-powered upcycling guide, a local marketplace, and direct partnership integrations into one seamless mobile-first experience.
